## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
This project despite it's simplicity was a little bit challenging. 
Some of the challenges were around how to place the arrow and make it look exactly
as the same as on the provided design. 
I had to review flexbox properties, css position and many more.

### Continued development

I think I have to continue working on the basics(HTML and CSS)
